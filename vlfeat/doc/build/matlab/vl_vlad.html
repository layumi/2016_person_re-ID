ENC = <a href="%pathto:vl_vlad;">VL_VLAD</a>(X, MEANS, ASSIGNMENTS) computes the VLAD
encoding of the vectors X relative to cluster centers MEANS and
vector-to-cluster soft assignments ASSIGNMENTS.
</p><p>
X has one column per data vector (e.g. a SIFT descriptor), and
MEANS has one column per component. Usually one has one component
per KMeans cluster and MEANS are the KMeans centers. X and MEANS
have the same number of rows and the data class, which can be
either SINGLE or DOUBLE.
</p><p>
ASSIGNMENTS has as many rows as clusters and as many columns as
X. Its columns are non-negative and should sum to one,
representing the soft assignment of the corresponding vector in X
to each of the clusters. It is of the same class as X.
</p><p>
ENC is a vector of the same class of X of size equal to the
product of the data dimension and the number of clusters.
</p><p>
By default, ENC is L2 normalized. <a href="%pathto:vl_vlad;">VL_VLAD</a>() accepts the following
options:
</p><dl><dt>
Unnormalized
</dt><dd><p>
If specified, no overall normalization is applied to ENC.
</p></dd><dt>
NormalizeComponents
</dt><dd><p>
If specified, the part of the encoding corresponding to each
cluster is individually normalized.
</p></dd><dt>
NormalizeMass
</dt><dd><p>
If specified, each component is re-normalized by the mass
of data vectors assigned to it. If NormalizedComponents is
also selected, this has no effect.
</p></dd><dt>
SquareRoot
</dt><dd><p>
If specified, the signed square root function is applied to
ENC before normalization.
</p></dd><dt>
Verbose
</dt><dd><p>
Increase the verbosity level (may be specified multiple times).
